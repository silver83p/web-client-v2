# DAO (Proposals) UI

This document describes the DAO / proposals feature as currently implemented in the web client.

## What’s implemented (current behavior)

### Entry point

- The DAO UI is opened from the main menu ("DAO").

### Modals

1. **DAO Modal**
   - Shows a list of proposals.
   - Includes a **Status filter** for server-provided proposal statuses and their **counts**.
   - The **All** status filter paginates every proposal in the complete metadata index.
   - The proposal list is filtered by the selected option.
   - Filters preserve the server metadata index order: status-transition timestamp descending, then proposal number descending.
   - Clicking a proposal opens the Proposal Info modal.
   - A floating **“+”** button opens the Add Proposal modal.

2. **Add Proposal Modal**
   - Allows creating a new proposal with:
     - Title
     - Summary
     - Type
     - A required **No change** option plus one or more options with parameter changes
     - A separate type-specific change set for each option
   - The UI validates and renders the nested proposal shape in the review modal, then signs and submits the nested proposal transaction.

3. **Proposal Info Modal**
   - Displays proposal:
     - Number (e.g. `Proposal #12`)
     - Title
     - Type label
     - State + timestamp + created-by
     - Summary
     - A card for every option, with each action option displaying only its matching nested parameter change set and its current/proposed values
   - Shows voting controls only when the proposal is in **Voting** state.
   - Voting is **Yes/No**, tracked per “voter id” derived from the current account:
     - `myAccount.address` / `myData.account.address` → fallback to username → fallback to `anon`.

### Proposal lifecycle (statuses)

The UI uses these statuses:

- `review`
- `withheld`
- `voting`
- `rejected`
- `accepted`
- `applied`

## Data model used by the UI

The UI consumes an in-memory “store” shape:

- `meta`: `{ count }`
- `proposals`: map of `proposalId -> full proposal`

Identifiers:

- `proposalId` is `${number}_${nonce}`.

Full proposal fields (current shape in memory):

- `number`, `nonce`
- `title`, `summary`
- `type`
- `state`
- `state_changed` (UI uses this as `stateEnteredAt`)
- `created` (UI uses this as `createdAt`)
- `createdBy`
- `fields` (type-specific)
- `votes`: `{ yes, no, by: Record<voterId, 'yes'|'no'> }`

For current multi-option proposals:

- `options[0]` is the negative/no-change choice.
- Each later option is mapped positionally to the selected type payload's nested change sets: `options[1]` → `changes[0]`, `options[2]` → `changes[1]`, and so on.
- The creation UI produces this nested `changes: ParamChange[][]` shape rather than the deprecated flat change list.

## Where the code lives

- DAO UI implementation: [app.js](app.js)
- In-memory repository abstraction: [dao.js](dao.js)
- Shared constants/helpers (states and type labels): [dao.js](dao.js)

Important implementation detail:

- The DAO UI requests the complete metadata index whenever the DAO is refreshed; proposal metadata is not persisted.
- Proposal details are not persisted. Status filters fetch fresh details for the visible 10 entries, “Load more” fetches the next 10, and opening a proposal refreshes that proposal again.
- The Claimable filter is intentionally disabled for this branch. Selecting it performs no proposal-detail requests and displays no proposals.
- Account changes and sign-out clear the in-memory proposal details.
- Failed detail fetches are retried the next time their filter page or proposal is opened.

## Backend Data Boundary

- `app.js` registers `setDaoBackendFetcher(createDaoBackendFetcher(queryNetwork))`.
- `dao.js` keeps endpoint querying and backend-to-UI mapping behind the repository boundary.
- Proposal list loading uses:
  - `GET /dao/proposals/meta` on every DAO refresh
  - `GET /dao/proposals/:number` for each entry on the visible filter page
- Status, emergency flag, and status-transition ordering always come from the metadata index overlay, not the detail payload.
- The fetcher skips an unavailable detail response so it does not block the remaining indexed proposals from rendering.
- The old exhaustive `1..N` list fallback is not used when the metadata index is empty.
- Below-threshold unapply votes do not change metadata and are not reflected until the applied proposal is queried again; live unapply tracking is outside this flow.

## What must change for a live backend

This section is the remaining integration checklist after moving the DAO list to real proposal query endpoints.

### 1) Keep backend fetch in `dao.js`

`daoRepo` uses an injected fetcher and otherwise returns an empty store.

The app passes `queryNetwork` into `createDaoBackendFetcher(...)`; the repository maps the metadata index and `DaoProposalAccount` payloads into the store shape the UI expects.

### 2) Define backend endpoints / payloads

Known read endpoints:

- `GET /dao/proposals/meta`
- `GET /dao/proposals/:number`

Still needed for later phases:

- Cast vote endpoint/action
- Proposal detail capability data for review, reward, and ready actions

### 3) Wire create + vote to backend

`daoRepo.createProposal(...)` builds the nested proposal transaction, and the Proposal Review modal signs and injects it. The transaction contains exactly one type payload matching `proposalType`, with a nested change set for each action option.

For production, cast-vote submission should refresh the proposal or patch vote totals from the server response.

### 4) Loading / errors / pagination

The UI already shows a basic loading empty-state while `daoRepo.refresh()` is running.

For production, consider adding:

- Incremental refresh (don’t blow away list on refresh)
- Better error states (retry button)

### 5) Auth / permissions

The UI derives a `voterId` from the account in memory, but a real backend will likely require:

- Auth headers / signed requests
- Permission checks (who can propose, who can vote)

That should be handled in the backend fetcher or shared network layer.
